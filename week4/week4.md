# Week 4 — Object Tracking 

## Overview
Week 4 focused on extending object detection to video-based analysis through object tracking and object detection. Using the trained YOLOv5 pedestrian detector from the previous week, a tracking-by-detection pipeline was implemented to follow individuals across video frames. This week emphasized understanding motion patterns and temporal consistency.

## Topics Covered

### Object Tracking Fundamentals
- Object tracking involves assigning a unique identity to detected objects and maintaining that identity across consecutive frames.
- Tracking builds on object detection by incorporating temporal information from videos.
- Tracking-by-detection pipelines rely on a detector to provide bounding boxes and a tracker to associate detections over time.
- Common challenges include occlusions, missed detections, and identity switches.

### Tracking Implementation
- YOLOv5 used as the pedestrian detector for each video frame.
- DeepSORT employed for multi-object tracking and ID assignment.
- Kalman filtering and data association used internally for motion prediction.
- Object trajectories generated by storing bounding box center points.

### Motion Analysis
- Tracking enabled analysis of pedestrian movement over time.
- Motion trajectories provided information about speed, direction, and movement patterns.
- These trajectories formed the basis for behavior analysis and anomaly detection.

### Final Results
- Achieved stable pedestrian tracking across video sequences.
- Maintained identity consistency even in moderately crowded scenes.
- Successfully produced trajectory plots and processed output videos.
- Demonstrated a complete detection-to-tracking pipeline suitable for surveillance-style analysis.


## Assignments / Work Done
- Implemented object tracking using YOLOv5 and DeepSORT.
- Stored and visualized object trajectories across video frames.
- Implemented video-based pedestrian tracking
- Generated processed videos with consistent object IDs

## Key Learnings
- Object tracking enables temporal understanding beyond frame-wise detection.
- Tracking-by-detection is an effective approach for multi-object tracking tasks.
- Motion trajectories provide valuable information for behavior analysis.


## Conclusion & Final Outcome
Week 4 completed the transition from object detection to full video-based analysis. The final system integrates YOLOv5-based detection with DeepSORT tracking to analyze pedestrian motion in real-world scenarios.
